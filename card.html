      <p class='fact'>Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness.
        Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better
        than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw;
        four toes on each back paw). Cats can jump up to six times their length.</p>

        carnivorous mammals, of the family Felidae. Domestic cats are
